Consider a circumstance where pose tracking would be useful to some
    indie developer -- video game, animator, etc.

Not everyone can afford to rip apart a studio, grid the entire room, etc. 

Instead, I will attempt to make a human pose tracker which is:
    + 3 dimension-enabled with multiple cameras 
    + Robust to lighting conditions, variable frame rates.
    + Potentially a live implementation?

Consider a 2 camera setup spaced at some angle

Use RCNN, Fast-RCNN, or Faster-RCNN - or some modern variant.

Identify pose with both cameras, use one for depth of the other if 90 degree separation.
    Otherwise, mathematically interpret based on angle difference.
